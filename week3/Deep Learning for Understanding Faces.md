### Deep Learning for Understanding Faces

 The key challenge in unconstrained face detection is that traditional features like Haar wavelets and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) do not capture salient facial information at different resolution, viewpoint, illumination, expression, skin color, occlusions, and cosmetics conditions. 

The authors present an overview of recent developments in designing an automatic face recognition system. Various multitask CNN-based approaches for face analytics have been discussed. The examples shown in the article demonstrate that subject-independent tasks benefit from multitask learning, and network initialization from the face recognition task. They also show
how these tasks help to improve face recognition performance.

Given the sufficient amount of annotated data and GPUs, DCNNs have been shown to yield impressive performance improvements. Still many issues remain to be addressed to make the DCNN-based systems robust and practical, such as reducing reliance on large training data sets, handling data bias and degradation in training data, incorporating domain knowledge, reducing the training time when the network goes deeper and wider, and building the theoretical foundations to understand the characteristics and behaviors of DCNN models.
